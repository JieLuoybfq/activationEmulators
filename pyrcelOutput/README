The csv files in this directory are used to train the various machine learning models. 

The variables of interest and their definitions are:
actFrac: The Pyrcel predicted activation fraction
Log10N: The log of the number concentration of aerosol (cm-3) 
Log10ug: The log of the aerosol radius (um)
Sigma_g: Aerosol mode standard deviation 
Kappa: Hygroscopicity
Log10V: The log of the vertical velocity (m s-1)
T: Temperature (Kelvin)
P: Pressure (Pa)

The ARG parameters are:
delta_actFrac_arg: The difference between the activated fraction predicted by the ARG scheme and the Pyrcel model
actFrac_arg: The activated fraction of aerosol predicted by the ARG scheme
smaxes_arg: Maximum supersaturation predicted by the ARG scheme

The Twomey parameters are:
delta_actFrac: The difference between the activated fraction predicted by the Twomey scheme and the Pyrcel model
actFrac_Twomey: The activated fraction of aerosol predicted by the Twomey scheme
Smax_Twomey: Maximum supersaturation predicted by the Twomey scheme
